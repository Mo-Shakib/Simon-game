# Simon Game

A simple, web-based implementation of the classic **Simon Game**, where players need to memorize and replicate a sequence of colors that progressively becomes longer. The game challenges the player's memory and reflexes as the sequence speeds up over time.

## Demo

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Replicate the color pattern shown by the game.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The sequence grows longer with each round, testing your memory.
- **Sound Effects**: Each color is paired with a distinct sound.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various devices and screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the color sequence displayed by the game.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. With each correct sequence, the game adds another color to the pattern.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key again.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for generating and verifying the sequence, handling user input, and adding interactivity.
